Overview: "Maybe" can either have a value (Just 4) or it can have
no value (Nothing). "Nothing" is sort of like saying the value is
undefined or null.

    type Maybe a
        = Just a
        | Nothing

This allows us to turn partial functions (functions that are
undefined for some inputs) into total functions (defined on all
inputs).

For instance, log(n) is undefined for all n <= 0, so it is a
partial function. The type of this partial function would be:

     log : Float -> Float

Which is not actually true! The "log" function can also produce
errors or "null" values, but this does not appear in the type.
Using "Maybe" fixes this issue, giving us a total function:

    safeLog : Float -> Maybe Float

From the type, we know that "safeLog" may not produce a number,
but it still always produces a value, even if it is "Nothing"!

    case xs of
      h::t -> Just h
